#GS541 Phylogeography Homework

I wanted to investigate the transmission history for Turkey. Thus, I first started by rebuilding for Europe only. I colored the trees by country as well as setting the geographic resolution to country in order to examine the transmissions in Europe in country level. When I examined the map, I observed that the first cases come from China to Europe and they spread all over Europe rapidly. I also examined the tree and observed a quite big clade coming from United Kingdom which is interesting. United Kingdom seems to have introduced many cases to Europe. I also observed two other clades transmitted from Italy and France. Asia, as expected, is the major source of transmission to Europe. 

I then filtered by Turkey and examined the transmission history from the tree. One of the major clades is originated from Asia and we can also see that the initial cases are transmitted from China. We then see another Asia originated clade yet continues in two different branches where one branch comes from United Kingdom and another is from France. Potentially due to the frequency of the air travel between these countries and Turkey, they played an important role in the transmission. When I examined the map, I also observed the Turkey plays a role in transmitting further to Asia, as well as transmitting to Russia and Belgium.
